	<h2><i> Dachshunds </i></h2>
		<body> <p> Easily recognized by its long body and stubby legs, the small and spunky dachshund has long been a family favorite. Though they may not look it, dachshunds were bred as ferocious hunters, employed on the trail to crawl into badger and rabbit holes to flush out their prey. Still sometimes used as hunting dogs, most modern dachshunds are just as happy with plenty of daily play followed by lazing around the home with their humans. </p>
	<h2><i> Corgis </i></h2>
		<p> With their perky ears, stubby legs, and huge grins, it's easy to see why the Pembroke Welsh corgi has so many fans. Bred as herding dogs in Wales, the Pembroke Welsh corgi's full haunches and adorable waddle belie her origins as a hardy working dog. They are loyal and watchful over their families—and also have a tendency to bark—corgis can make good home alarm systems.</p>
